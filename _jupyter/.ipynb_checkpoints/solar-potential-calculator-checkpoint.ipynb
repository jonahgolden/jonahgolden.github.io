    "The sun emits a fairly consistent amount of power outwards in all directions.  The amount of power it emits is called solar luminosity (abbreviated as L0 ) and is equal to 3.9×〖10〗^26 watts.  Solar luminosity is emitted in all directions, and for the purposed of this project, it is necessary to determine the power per area that is transmitted from the sun to the Earth.  First, it is useful to picture a giant sphere that surrounds the sun.  This imaginary sphere is the perfect size so that Earth is on its surface.  If we divide the solar luminosity by the surface area of this sphere (in square meters), then we will be able to know the power per square meter that the sun gives to Earth.  The radius of this sphere is equal to the distance of Earth from the sun (1.5×〖10〗^11 m) plus the radius of the sun (6.96×〖10〗^8 m).  Therefore, the radius of the imaginary sphere is 1.50696×〖10〗^11 m.  Surface area (SA) is equal to 4πr^2, so:"
